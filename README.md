# blogpractice

This is the repository for the practice of making blog application with Django.

## rebuiliding from scratch

After I learn how to make the blog project in the class, I found out that this has to be practiced a lot to get used to it. So I'm going to build the blog project as many as possible that I can until I fully understand and be good at making it.

## many failed projects

Because this repository is for the practice, many of the projects within here would not be fully operable.
